<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
This document is an ongoing effort to
describe the internal operation of the Unidata 
ast protobuf compiler and code generator.

There are several reasons for creating ast.
<ul>
<li> The existing
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-c">C code generator</a>
generates overly complicated code.
As a rule, what is needed is code to
serialize (aka encode) and deserialize (aka decode)
protobuf messages.  The RPC support should be entirely
separate from the (de)serialize code.  Even Google is
deprecating the RPC output for, one presumes, the same reason.
<p>
<li> The Unidata ast compiler uses a more traditional compiler approach
based on the use of a (mostly) read-only abstract syntax tree (AST).
The key is that the AST is never (well, almost never)
modified to add language specific code, which is the approach
of the Google compiler.  Instead, code generation is performed
by repeatedly walking the bare AST to obtain information.
<p>
The result is a much cleaner system with the AST serving as
a well-defined and fixed intermediary between parsing and
code generation.
<p>
<li>Java is a much better language that C++ for writing portable
compilers.
<p>
<li>Finally, building the AST compiler helped the author
to get a better understanding of the protobuf protocol.
</ul>
A C language code generator accompanies the compiler to demonstrate
its use. Other code generators for, e.g. Java and C++, are possible,
but the existing google generators are probably adequate for those
languages.
<p>
The rest of this document describes two relatively independent
code sets. First, the internal operation of the compiler
is discussed so that a developer has the ability to add translation
to a new language if desired.
Second, the internal operation of the C language runtime is described.

<h2><u>Compiler Internal Operations</u></h2>

The Unidata ast compiler uses a traditional compiler approach
based on the use of an abstract syntax tree (AST).
The key idea is that the AST is (almost) never
modified to add language specific code.
All processing and code generation is performed by repeatedly walking
the AST to (1) annotate nodes in the tree, and (2) generate the output
code (C in our case).
<p>
The AST approach differs from that used in Google's protobuf compiler.
Google's compiler also has, effectively, an AST underlying it, but its
overall structure is mostly hidden. Instead, the Google compiler
uses a relatively pure O-O approach in which the nodes of the tree
are mapped to classes that are extended with code to perform
various semantic and code-generation operations. 
<p>
Aside from the relative merits of C++ (Google) versus Java (Unidata),
the resulting AST-based compiler provides a much more centralized
approach for defining the generation of the output code.
Basically this means that one can look at the file <i>CGenerator.java</i>
and see in one place all the procedures involved in code generation.
Extending the system to provide, say, support for translation to another
language, then just requires the developer to duplicate <i>CGenerator.java</i>
and modify it to generate the desired new language output.

<h3>The Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Structure</h3>
In order to understand code generation, it is necessary to have some
understanding of the AST node structure.
<a href="#appendixa">Appendix A</a>.
lists all of the node types (along with their primary interface procedures)
that may occur in an AST.
<p>
The parser initially produces a raw AST tree.
The file <i>ProtobufSemantics.java</i> walks the raw tree
and (1) checks for semantic legality and (2) modifies the
tree to fully implement some the interface procedures listed in
<a href="#appendixa">Appendix A</a>.
<p>
The semantic processor performs the following actions
in the following order.
<ol>
<li>Setup
    <ol>
    <li>Construct a set of nodes representing the primitive types.
    <li>Remove any duplicate file importations.
    <li>Cross-link the file nodes and the package nodes.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>Collect global node sets
    <ol>
    <li>Collect the set of all AST tree nodes and store in the tree root.
    <li>Collect the set of all AST package and file nodes and store in the tree root.
    <li>Link all nodes to the root node.
    <li>Link all nodes to their parent node (if any).
    </ol>
<p>
<li>Collect sub-trees
    <ol>
    <li>For each node collect the set of nodes in the subtree below it
        (this is, roughly, the transitive closure of the child set).
        However, for each file node, exclude any contained file subtrees.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>Set file link
    <ol>
    <li>Link each node to the source file from which it came.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>Set package link
    <ol>
    <li>Link each node to the closest containing package.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>Collect node sets
    <ol>
    <li>Fill in various fields for each node type.
        For example, for AST.File nodes, collect and store
        the set of all contained messages, extends, enums, and
        services.
    <li>Collect the set of options that apply to a given node.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>Set scope names
    <ol>
    <li>Assign the scope name to each node.
        The scope name is a canonical name for each node.
        For messages, for example, it is the message type name.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>Set qualified names(root)) return false;
    <ol>
    <li>The (fully) qualified name is the concatenation of scope names
        from the root to the specified node. 
    </ol>
<p>
<li>Check duplicate names
    <ol>
    <li>Check for duplicate qualified names.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>Dereference
    <ol>
    <li>For nodes that reference other nodes by name, make a direct
        link from the node to the node that it references. For example,
        AST.Extend nodes will link directly to the corresponding
        AST.Message node.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>Miscellanous checks
    <ol>
    <li>Check that all msg ids appear legal and are not duplicates.
    <li>Check for duplicate enum field values.
    <li>Check that extend fields do not conflict with the base message.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>Apply extensions
    <ol>
    <li> Locate extension nodes and insert into the corresponding
         base message; also mark fields as extensions.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>Define options
    <ol>
    <li>Define any predefined options.
    <li>De-reference the type of the option.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>Map options
    <ol>
    <li>Copy the raw options for each node into the optionmap for that node.
    <li>Capture value of selected true/false options (e.g. packed).
    <li>Pull in any defined options from the System.getProperties() list.
        This list is the one produced by the <i>-D</i> flags set when
        invoking java. This method of defining options is deprecated.
    <li>Pull in any defined options from the Main.defines() list.;
        This list is the one produced by the <i>-D</i> flags set as arguments
	to the main. In effect there are two sets of <i>-D</i> flags.
        This set of flags is preferred over using the Java -D flags.
    </ol>
</ol>

<h2>Option Handling</h2>
After semantic processing, each node has
an associated <i>optionmap</i>, which
maps an option name to an arbitrary value object.
This allows user defined code to easily access
the value associated with an option for a given node
using the following procedure.
<pre>
    Object optionLookup(String key);
</pre>

<h2>Annotating the AST</h2>
After semantic processing, the
AST is considered to be read-only.
However, a mechanism is provided for
annotating nodes of the tree with translation specific information.
Every AST node has the type <i>AST</i> as its ultimate supertype.
This type has two functions for annotation.
<ol>
<li>Object getAnnotation();
<li>void setAnnotation(Object);
</ol>
<p>
The <i>setAnnotation</i>
procedure associates an arbitary object
with a specified AST node.
The <i>getAnnotation</i>
function returns any annotation associated
with a specified AST node. If there is no
annotation, then the Java value <i>null</i> is returned.
<p>
The C code translator makes little use of
the annotation capability. It annotates
the top level AST.File node
with instances of the following structure.
<pre>
static public class Annotation
{
    String fileprefix = null;
    String filebase = null;
    List<AST.File> includes = null;
}
</pre>
<p>
The fileprefix is the directory and the filebase is the filename
of the output file. The includes field list the set of
<i>#include</i>directives to place in the output file.

<h2><u>Runtime Internal Operations</u></h2>
<h3>Key Data Structures</h3>
The primary data structure of interest
is the the <i>ast_runtime</i> structure
(defined in <i>ast_runtime.h</i>).
It is passed to the (de)serialize procedures.
<p>
The 
<i>Runtime</i>
structure is defined as follows.
<pre>
struct Runtime {
    unsigned long long uid;
    ast_iomode mode;
    ast_runtime_ops* ops;
    void* stream;
    int err;
}
</pre>
The fields have the following semantics.
<table>
<tr valign=top><td>uid<td>&mdash;
<td>A unique number identifying who created runtime object: e.g. ast_byteio.
<tr valign=top><td>mode<td>&mdash;
<td>Track the mode of operation: encode/write/serialize,
decode/read/deserialize, and free.
<tr valign=top><td>ops<td>&mdash;
<td>Dispatch table for standardized operations (see below).
<tr valign=top><td>stream<td>&mdash;
<td>Opaque object on which I/O is performed.
<tr valign=top><td>err<td>&mdash;
<td>This is a place to store error return codes.
It is the ast equivalent to the C errno global variable.
</table>
<p>
Additionally, <i>ast_runtime.h</i> defines a type, called <i>bytes_t</i>,
that is used to support the reading and writing of counted byte strings.
Its definition is as follows.
<pre>
typedef struct bytes_t{
    size_t nbytes;
    unsigned char* bytes;
} bytes_t;
</pre> 
<h4>Error Return Values</h4>
Most procedures (including the generated read and write procedures)
will return an ast error code as defined in <i>ast_runtime.h</i>
The current set of error codes is as follows.
<table>
<tr valign=top><td>AST_NOERR<td>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
<td>The normal return value when no error occurred. This is always
defined to have the value zero. All other ast error codes are
defined as negative integers.
<tr valign=top><td>AST_EOF<td>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
<td>An end-of-file was encountered in reading from a stream.
This may or may not be a fatal error.
<tr valign=top><td>AST_ENOMEM<td>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
<td>Allocatable memory is exhausted.
<tr valign=top><td>AST_EFAIL<td>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
<td>Generic failure of some kind; log output may provide
more information.
<tr valign=top><td>AST_EIO<td>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
<td>An I/O error occurred in reading or writing a stream.
</table>
<p>
Additional errors will be added over time, so this list
may be out of data with respect to <i>ast_runtime.h</i>.
<p>
The function <i>ast_strerror</i> will convert an error code
to a printable string providing a readable error message.

<h4>IO Stream Structures</h4>
The combination of the opaque <i>stream</i> field
plus the <i>ops</i> field
in an <i>ast_runtime</i> object
are used to provide support for an extensible set
of I/O mechanisms.
<p>
The ast runtime system comes with one such I/O mechanism
that reads and writes in-memory byte strings.
Additional I/O mechanisms can be defined and used
as long as they adhere to the semantics of the operations.
It would be possible, for example, to write a I/O mechanism
wrapping a C FILE* based input/output, or socket-based I/O.
<p>
The standardized operations (ast_runtime_ops)
are defined as follows.
<pre>
struct ast_runtime_ops {
    size_t  (*write)(ast_runtime*,size_t,uint8_t*);
    size_t  (*read)(ast_runtime*,size_t,uint8_t*);
    ast_err (*mark)(ast_runtime*,size_t);
    ast_err (*unmark)(ast_runtime*);
    ast_err (*reclaim)(ast_runtime*);
    void*   (*alloc)(ast_runtime*,size_t);
    void    (*free)(ast_runtime*,void*);
};
</pre>
<p>
The semantics of the operations are defined in the following table.
<table>
<tr valign=top><td><td>
<tr valign=top><td>write<td>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
<td>Writes N bytes of data to the stream object.
<tr valign=top><td>read<td>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
<td>Reads N bytes of data from the stream object.
<tr valign=top><td>mark<td>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
<td>Marks the input stream so that an attempt
to read more than N bytes will cause an EOF.
Multiple nested marks are supported.
<tr valign=top><td>unmark<td>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
<td>Restore previous mark limit in LIFO order.
<tr valign=top><td>reclaim<td>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
<td>Reclaim (i.e, free) this ast_runtime instance.
<tr valign=top><td>alloc<td>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
<td>Wrapper for malloc/calloc; allocates a chunk of memory.
<tr valign=top><td>free<td>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
<td>Wrapper for the free function; frees previously allocated memory.
</table>
<p>
Each function is passed the controlling <i>ast_runtime</i> object
as its first argument. This allows the I/O mechanism to
access at least the opaque stream object, cast it as necessary,
and then operate on it.
<p>
For each such I/O mechanism, one additional procedure
is usually implemented: one to create the opaque stream object.
<p>
Looking at <i>ast_byteio.h</i>, these two procedures are defined
as follows.
<pre>
ast_err ast_byteio_new(ast_iomode, void* buf, size_t len, ast_runtime**);
</pre>
<p>
This procedure creates either a readable or writeable (as defined by the
first argument) byte stream. For reading, the actual underlying buffer 
and its size are provided. For writing, the buffer is NULL and will be
created by the procedure.  There are actually two return values,
the ast error code is returned as the procedure value. Additionally,
an <i>ast_runtime</i> object is created and a pointer to it is returned
in the last argument.

<h3><u><a name="appendixa">Appendix A: AST Node Types</a></u></h3>
Note that the term "type" is being used loosely. In fact, the
"types" are implemented as Java <i>interfaces</i>. The concrete
classes implementing the interfaces are in the file
<i>ASTDefault.java</i>
(but see also <i>ASTFactory.java</i>).
